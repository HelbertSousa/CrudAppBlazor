# Blazor CRUD APP

- This repository will be used to organize new knowledge about .Net, C# and Blazor, and the Entity Framework will also be used.

- To do this, a CRUD will be created generating Blazor components with a Scaffolding, so that parts of the application can be created automatically, acting as a project initializer.
